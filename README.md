# limeCopycat
Another Bootstrap exercise done as a copycat of this website: http://www.opendesigns.org/design/lemon/

This time I made a Bootstrap-style navbar. And while I can't see the footer of this website in the image, I made a proper footer with accordions. There is a bit of Javascript added to update the icon for an active accordion.
